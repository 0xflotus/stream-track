'chk-followups.py' finds upstream commits that fixes or mentions specific
commits and check whether the followup changes in the upstream are already in
your downstream tree.

Suppose that you are developing your linux kernel on a branch based on a v5.4
stable release.  You periodically rebase your work on latest 5.4 stable release
to ensure your kernel is safe.  But, you also back-ported some commits from
v5.5.  Now the periodic rebasing cannot ensure you have all necessary fixes in
your kernel, as the fixes for the back-ported commits will land on only v5.5 or
later stable releases.  'chk-followups.py' is the tool for such cases.

Getting Started
===============

Let's suppose your kernel repo is at '$HOME/linux' and tracking the mainline
tree with a remote name 'mainline'.  Your working branch is named 'hack' and
based on v5.4.42.

```
$ chk-followups.py --repo $HOME/linux \
	--downstream v5.4.42..hack --upstream v5.5..mainline/master
```

Above command will do the check for all commits in 'v5.4.42..hack' against all
commits in 'v5.5..mainline/master'.

Output Format
=============

The output will classify each of the downstream commits with a combination of
below tags:

 - downstream_only: The commit is in the downstream only.  Maybe you made this
   change on your own.
 - no_followup: The upstream has no commits for the commit.
 - fixed: There are upstream commits fixing the commit.  This is classified by
   checking the 'Fixes' tag.
 - mentioned: There are upstream commits mentioning the commit.  This could be
   non-fixes (e.g., merge), but would be worth to check.
 - unmerged: The followup commit is not merged in the downstream.  You should
   carefully check how things are going on.

In case of fixed or mentioned, the followup commits will also be listed.  For
example:

    x86/unwind/orc: Prevent unwinding before ORC initialization # fixed
      fixes merged
        71c95825289f ("x86/unwind/orc: Fix error handling in __unwind_start()")
    bnxt_en: Improve AER slot reset. # fixed,unmerged
      fixes unmerged
        6e2f83884c09 ("bnxt_en: Fix AER reset logic on 57500 chips.")
    KEYS: Don't write out to userspace while holding key semaphore # mentioned,unmerged
      mentions unmerged
        4c205c84e249 ("Merge tag 'keys-fixes-20200329' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs")
